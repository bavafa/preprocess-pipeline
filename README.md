# preprocess-pipeline
Preprocessing, Pipelines and Hyperparameter Tuning
This is project prepared for the BAIT 509: Business Applications of Machine Learning at UBC Sauder School of Business. 
Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/adult-census-income

The main goals for the project were:
- Implement feature transformations such as imputation and scaling.
- Apply sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline to build a machine learning pipeline.
- Use sklearn for applying numerical feature transformations on the data.
- Apply ordinal encoding vs one-hot encoding.
- Explore strategies to deal with categorical variables with too many categories.
- Use ColumnTransformer to build all our transformations together into one object and use it with scikit-learn pipelines.
- Carry out hyperparameter optimization using RandomizedSearchCV.
